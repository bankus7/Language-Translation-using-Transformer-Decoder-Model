## Introduction

The Transformer architecture has revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) by providing a more efficient and effective way to model sequential data. In this project, we delve into language translation using the Transformer Decoder Model. We explore the masking techniques employed in Transformers and implement the decoder architecture for machine translation.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of the experiment, you will be able to:

- Understand the big picture of transformers
- Explore masking of transformers
- Implement Transformer decoder and understand its architecture
- Apply learning on a machine translation problem

## Usage

### Running the Notebook Locally

To run the notebook locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Language-Translation-using-Transformer-Decoder-Model.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

    ```
    cd Language-Translation-using-Transformer-Decoder-Model
    ```

3. Open the notebook file `Language_Translation_using_Transformer_Decoder_Model.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

4. Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Execute the notebook cells one by one to understand the Transformer architecture, implement the decoder, and apply it to a machine translation problem.

### Running the Notebook on Google Colab

You can also run the notebook directly in your browser using Google Colab. Click the "Open in Colab" badge above, and it will open the notebook in Colab. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the cells and perform the analysis.
